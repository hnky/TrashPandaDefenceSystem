## Session Abstract

For many scenarios, the cloud is used as a way to process data and apply business logic with nearly limitless scale. However, processing data in the cloud is not always the optimal way to run computational workloads: either because of connectivity issues, legal concerns, or because you need to respond in near-real time with processing at the Edge.

In this session we dive into how [Azure IoT Edge](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-edge/?WT.mc_id=aiml-0000-heboelma) 
can help in this scenario. We will train a machine learning model in the cloud using the 
[Microsoft AI Platform](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/?product=ai-machine-learning&WT.mc_id=aiml-0000-heboelma) and deploy this model to an IoT Edge device using 
[Azure IoT Hub](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-hub/?WT.mc_id=aiml-0000-heboelma).

At the end, you will understand how to develop and deploy AI & Machine Learning workloads at the Edge.
